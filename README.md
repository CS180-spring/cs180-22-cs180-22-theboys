# E-Commerce NFT Website

For this project, our team decided to create a full-stack E-commerce web application that allows users to purchase NFTs. Our user interface will have a similar design as those of other companies. Users will be able to sign in to their unqiue account and make purchases. The web application will also allow users to be able to view their purchase history and view the items in their cart. Payment information will also be handled so that payments can be made successfully. 

# Languages

The primary languages we used in this project are JavaScript, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS. All of our files are sent to and retrieved from the Amazon Web Service in a JSON format. PostgreSQL is used in order to query specific information regarding a user, a product, and any other relevant entities. HTML and CSS are primarily used as tools to develop the website that is used as our user interface.

## Available Scripts

For this project, we utilized React.js for our front-end development. In order to start our web application,you can run:

### `npm start`

This comman runs the app in development mode.\
You can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make any changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
